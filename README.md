# TechFest X RAC Workshop Resources
### Techfest, IIT Bombay

This repository refers to the workshop conducted by the Robotics and Aviation Club, RBU, in collaboration with TECHFEST (IIT Bombay) on 18.09.24.  
Techfest is the annual science and technology festival of the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, consisting of social initiatives and outreach programs throughout the year.

### Contents Covered in the Workshop
Refer to the **RAC_Techfest.pdf** for an introduction to basic electronics and two beginner projects that will help you build a strong foundation for your future projects.

1. **Cosmo Clench**: This project mainly focuses on the 'hardware' and 'mechanics' aspects of building a bot.
2. **Meshmerize**: This project is more logic-oriented and focuses on programming and logic building.

**NOTE:** All robots require some level of software and hardware integration, which means it's essential to know the basics of both fields.

The above two projects will help build your fundamentals in "programming and logic" as well as "power electronics and hardware."

## ARDUINO
Arduino is a beginner-friendly platform for building electronics projects. It features easy-to-use microcontroller boards (like the Arduino Uno) and a simple programming environment. You can connect components like sensors, LEDs, and motors to create interactive devices. Affordable and widely supported, Arduino is ideal for learning electronics and programming, with popular starter projects like blinking LEDs and temperature monitors.

## Meshmerize
Line followers are autonomous robots that are programmed to follow a specific path within a given time limit.

Line followers can also be modified into maze solvers using different programming logic while using the same hardware as line followers.

### Prerequisites
1. Basic programming logic (C/C++)
2. Arduino IDE
